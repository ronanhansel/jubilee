**An beginer friendly, open source discord bot for anyone (who's interested)**

A small side project I develop and maintain in my free time. I'll try to keep the code as clean and pleasing as possible (if you still see it's a mess, believe me I am trying). Want to ask some questions? Ask right here by creating a new issue or just join the server below (a general-purpose server I created to test out my bot, but you guys can join in and start conversasions there, I'm friendly). Remember

Join Discord Server in which I try and test out this bot, to see me get frustrated? I'd be surprised if anyone showed up 👀


If the code gets more complicated, I'll make sure I note everything needed here in `readme.md` so dont worry 👍
